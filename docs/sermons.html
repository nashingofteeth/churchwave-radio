I will cause you sudden terrors and you will no longer exist; though you will be sought, you will never be found again,' declares the Lord God."

His Day is almost upon us; it cannot be stopped.</p><p>2 EVILA is the newest Message from Brother Evila Seh, set to music by plunderphonics musician WAV Rewinder.</font></p>

Evila took a lead role in the conception and production of a project between him and WAV Rewinder, resulting in this first full-length radio sermon from Shaking Time Ministries. A nontraditional and strangely autobiographical look at Br. Evila's foundational doctrines, this abstract program covers a wide range of topics from the nature of God to the commodification of the church.</font></p>
