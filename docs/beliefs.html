<b><font size="+4">21 Fundamental Beliefs</font></b>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" align="left" bgcolor="#D6B363" colspan="2">
<p><b><font size="+1">Though the foundation of Shaking Time Ministries lies in the doctrine of the Seventh-Day Adventist church, the two differ in a few key respects.</p><p><font size="+2">1. <u>We do not believe Ellen White had the gift of prophecy.</u></font><ul>
      <li>She herself never claimed to be a "prophet," and only referred to herself as a "messenger."</li>
      <li>It is <a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/122.620">well-documented</a> that she supported a child-molesting Adventist pastor and participated in a cover-up of his crimes.</li>
      <li>Several <a href="https://nonsda.org/egw/egw102.shtml">key points in her Biblical commentaries</a> were plagiarized from Paradise Lost and other sources.</li>
      <li>While vegetarianism, one of the major cruxes of White's health message, is a key aspect of our ministry, we acknowledge that White made many dubious claims about healthcare, including <a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/384.1377">advice</a> to only eat two large meals per day and that masturbation causes <a href="https://nonegw.org/criticc.shtml">a long list</a> of unrelated health conditions.</li>
      <li>Many of her critics point to <a href="https://nonsda.org/egw/criticd.shtml">the many failed or disappointing prophecies</a> she made, but for us there is none more egregious than the prophecy of the nonsensical <a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/39.768">Sunday Law</a>, which this ministry wholly disavows.</li>
      <li>She <a href="https://nonegw.org/egw25.shtml">may not have adhered as strictly to her convictions as many claim</a>.</li>
    </ul>While much of Ellen White's writings are phenomenal study guides and this ministry would not exist without the work she and other early Adventist pioneers did as theologians, it is critical to examine her work through the lens of a flawed human being and not elevate her to a pedestal as the direct mouthpiece of God.</p><p><font size="+2">2. <u>We do not exclude believers based on the day they worship or their baptismal status.</font></u><ul><li>While it is true that God rested on the seventh day and made it holy, and that many in this ministry personally choose Saturday as a day of rest and worship to God, and that many of our fellowship and worship events are held on the seventh day, we do not believe worshipping on a different day disqualifies you from the Kingdom of God. In fact, it is ludicrous to claim that any minor theological difference could exclude a believer while also professing to believe in a system of salvation through grace and not works!</li><li>Likewise, whether you were baptised as an infant or through a non-immersive means, you are welcome in our ministry. A public display of your covenant with God is a beautiful symbol that many in our ministry choose to make, but it is not a necessary piece to salvation.</li></ul>All symbolic traditions or rituals practiced by the Seventh-Day Adventist church &mdash; communion, feet-washing, week of prayer, Ingathering, Sabbath school, etc. &mdash; are not necessary for salvation or your acceptance within the Body of Christ. This also stands for traditions and rituals eschewed by the SDA church, including Christmas trees, music with electric instruments, jewelry, divorce, bicycles... Our ministry will not reject you out for any of these reasons!</p><p><font size="+2">3. <u>We do not believe that the Bible explicitly condemns homosexuality.</font></u><p>Many progressive Adventists will say they do not hate gay people, but the Bible is very explicit about the status of homosexuality as a sin. This is not necessarily true. The six passages in the Bible that refer to same-sex relations are denouncing crimes of sexual violence that are not unique to homosexual interaction. There is no evidence that the Bible condemns same-sex relationships of love and mutuality.</p><ul><li><u><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%2019&version=NASB&interface=print">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></u>: The crime the people of these wicked cities committed was <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%2019%3A4-7&version=NASB&interface=print">rape</a>.</li><li><u><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%2019&version=NASB&interface=print">The Levite's concubine</a></u>: Likewise, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%2019%3A22-23&version=NASB&interface=print">the "worthless" Benjamites</a> in this story were trying to forcefully have nonconsensual sex with a visiting outsider.</li><li><u><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20kings%2015%3A8-24&version=NASB&interface=print">The Reign of Asa</a></u>: The Bible says King Asa did "what was right in the sight of the LORD, like his father David." Some will point to the destruction of "male cult prostitutes" and their idols under his reign as a sign that God detests homosexuality, but there is much more evidence in the Bible that He does indeed detest prostitution and idolatry.</li><li><u><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev.%2018%3A22-24&version=NASB&interface=print">The Levitical Laws</a></u>: Many of the laws God gave to the Israelites during this period concern managing the bloodline to preserve the lineage of Jesus and keep His people free of disease as they maintained a nomadic lifestyle. The vast majority of them (like laws about <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%201&version=NASB&interface=print">burnt offerings</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2019%3A19&version=NASB&interface=print">mixing fabrics</a>, and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2012&version=NASB&interface=print">quarantining menstruating women</a>) are irrelevant to people today with access to modern medicine. Oddly enough, none of the people using these verses to decry homosexuality adhere to the other Levitical requirements.</li><li><u>The Writings of Paul in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%206%3A9-10&version=NASB&interface=print">1 Corinthians</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20tim%201%3A9-10&version=NASB&interface=print">1 Timothy</a></u>: After consulting the original Greek, most scholars agree that a better translation for "homosexuals" in these passages would be "pederasts," which again is a crime of sexual violence and not sexual preference. It should also be noted that Paul notoriously <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%207%3A1-9&version=NASB&interface=print">cautioned believers against marriage and indeed all forms of sexual contact</a>.</li></ul>Because we do not believe the Bible condemns loving and mutual homosexual relationships, <u>we also support same-sex marriage</u>. You can read more about our thoughts on homosexuality and LBGTQ+ issues elsewhere on our site.</p><p><font size="+2">4. <u>We believe that women can be ordained ministers of the gospel.</font></u></p>We only recently added this fourth point to our site. Like many actual Seventh-Day Adventist Church members, we have been repeatedly appalled by the failure of the General Conference to allow regional conferences to uphold their own internal votes on this matter, instead enforcing narrow interpretations of the Bible that hinge on English translations of a few select verses. There are a litany of verses in the Bible that explicitly place women alongside men as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal.%203%3A27-29&version=NASB&interface=print">members of the Body of Christ</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joel%202%3A28-29&version=NASB&interface=print">recipients of the gift of prophecy</a>, and indeed, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Tim.%203%3A16-17&version=NASB&interface=print">ministers of the Gospel</a>. The fact that the church continues to insist on debating this topic when Paul himself <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2016%3A1-2&version=NASB&interface=print">recognized Phoebe as a deacon of the church at Cenchrea</a> is insulting.</p><p><br><font size="+2"><center>Below are 21 beliefs that we consider to be the fundamental tenants of our ministry:</center></p>
