<b><font size="+1"><p>Shaking Time Ministries was founded in 2019. The Lead Minister, Br. Evila Seh, heard the call from a very young age. After gaining some notoriety as a teen preacher and student prayer leader at <a href="https://ucaa.org/">Upper Columbia Academy</a>, he attended <a href="https://www.andrews.edu/index.html">Andrews University</a> and now holds a baccalaureate in Theology and an associate's in Christian Discipleship. Though recognized by many to possess the gift of prophecy, Evila was denied official ordination and sought the freedom to profess as God impressed. Stirred by the Book of Jeremiah and its clear parallels to his life and to the current day, he established this ministry in New York City, where he continues to oversee the spread of our urgent Message through street-level teachings and our pirate radio programs.</p><p>While this ministry may be viewed and understood most effectively through the prismatic lens of Seventh-day Adventism, this ministry is neither sponsored nor endorsed by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In the interest of scholarly integrity we will never seek such an endorsement.</p><p>As Paul indicated in his letter to the Galatians, the gospel is not of human beings [<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal.%201%3A10&version=NASB&interface=print">1:10</a>] and those sharing the gospel are not sent from men or by men [<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal.%201%3A1&version=NASB&interface=print">1:1</a>]. To that end, we would encourage each of you to humbly seek God's will for your own life and enter into a direct relationship with him. Others may fail you, but God is the only sure foundation that will sustain you when the flood waters inevitably rise.</p><p>We do ask your prayers for this ministry and all those whose lives it touches. This is a genuine ministry from God which means we will never ask you for donations. God does not need your money. He has sustained the members of this ministry for over 25 years through economic hardships, housing instability, and a global pandemic. None of us have ever found it necessary to own mansions, private jets, or luxury cars to spread the Gospel.</p><p>You can explore our digital footprint here:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@wavrewinder7906">You Tube</a></p><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/shakingtimeministries">Sound Cloud</a></p><p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shakingtimeministries">Tik Tok</a></p><p><a href="https://shakingtime.bandcamp.com/">Band Camp</a></p>
